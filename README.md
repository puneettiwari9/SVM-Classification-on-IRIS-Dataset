# SVM Classification Project

This repository contains an implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification using Python. The project demonstrates how to train an SVM model, visualize decision boundaries, analyze results using a confusion matrix, and perform data visualization on the dataset.


##  Project Overview

This project applies an SVM classifier on the dataset you provided. The workflow includes:

* Loading and preprocessing the dataset
* Visualizing data (scatter plots of selected features)
* Training an SVM classifier
* Plotting the SVM decision boundary
* Evaluating the model with a confusion matrix

##  Machine Learning Model — SVM
The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm tries to find the **best separating hyperplane** between different classes. It works by maximizing the margin between class boundaries.

### **Why use SVM?**

* Works well on small & medium datasets
* Effective in high‑dimensional spaces
* Good for binary classification tasks

##  Visualizations

Below are the plots generated by the code:

## 📝 Results Summary

* The confusion matrix shows model predictions vs. true labels
* Decision boundary plot shows clear separation between classes
* Overall, the SVM classifier performs strongly on the dataset
